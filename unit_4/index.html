<!-- Should we add in something else? -->
<!--My name is Nomathade “Chris” Jenkins and I’m a 25 year old living in New York City. After graduating from Cornell University in 2015, I worked for Ernst & Young’s Financial Services consulting arm for three years. After a few years in consulting, specifically servicing Financial Services clients, I realized that this industry wasn’t right for me. I loved the idea of providing value to my clients, increasing their efficiency and helping them to execute on their strategic goals, but I didn’t feel a strong connection with the purpose of my work. Fast forward six months later, and I’ve assumed a role as an Enterprise Engagement Manager at General Assembly, an Ed-Tech start-up based out of NYC with the mission statement of “empowering people to do the work they love”. After going through this process, and realizing that I wasn’t the only one of my friends with this dissonance between moral purpose and career path, I decided to create a podcast! Hopefully this podcast will provide you with actionable, relatable and “pragmatic” advice to navigate your career and find the role that satisfies your moral purpose.-->
