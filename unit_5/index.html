	<p>Right now, there are many podcasts which provide a platform for seasoned professionals to reflect on the early days of their careers and impart advice down toward millennials. In the Pragmatic Millennial podcast, we break with that trend and instead showcase advice for millennials by millennials. During this season, listeners will hear from a wide variety of millennials, spanning a range of backgrounds and geographies about their experience navigating within industries like: education, tech, finance, marketing and design. These millennials have had their first post college experience and recently underwent the career transition process, therefore they will be able to provide pragmatic and actionable advice that’s directly applicable to the millennial experience.</p>

<!-- Should we add in something else? -->
<!--My name is Nomathade “Chris” Jenkins and I’m a 25 year old living in New York City. After graduating from Cornell University in 2015, I worked for Ernst & Young’s Financial Services consulting arm for three years. After a few years in consulting, specifically servicing Financial Services clients, I realized that this industry wasn’t right for me. I loved the idea of providing value to my clients, increasing their efficiency and helping them to execute on their strategic goals, but I didn’t feel a strong connection with the purpose of my work. Fast forward six months later, and I’ve assumed a role as an Enterprise Engagement Manager at General Assembly, an Ed-Tech start-up based out of NYC with the mission statement of “empowering people to do the work they love”. After going through this process, and realizing that I wasn’t the only one of my friends with this dissonance between moral purpose and career path, I decided to create a podcast! Hopefully this podcast will provide you with actionable, relatable and “pragmatic” advice to navigate your career and find the role that satisfies your moral purpose.-->
